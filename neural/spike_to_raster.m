% Converts a spike train matrix or vector into rasters. If a
% single trial is input, a single raster is returned. If a matrix or cell array of trials
% is input, an matrix of rasters is returned aligned on alignmentIndex
%
% spikeTrainMatrix: A vector/matrix of trial/trials containing spike times.
% Each row is a trial, each column is one ms
%
% alignmentTimeList (optional): A vector list of times to align each respective trial to form an aligned matrix of rows of rasters
%
%
%
% alignedRasters: The raster or aligned rasters
%
% alignmentIndex: The index that the rasters are aligned to if a spike
% train matrix was input.

% 1. Change the spikeTrain matrix to rasters
% 2. Align the rasters on alignmentTimeList
%
% spikeTrainMatrix:         [trials X spike trains], each nonzero number in
% a row is the time of a spike on that trial
%
% alignmentTimeList:        [trials X 1], each number is the time to align
% the rasters for each trial.
%
