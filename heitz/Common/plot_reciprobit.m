    %first, get the cumulative distribution of observed RTs
    
    %this does not need to be sorted to get the cumulative probability, because
    %its always just a portion of the RTD so far.  But you have to *PLOT* it by
    %the sorted RTs or it won't work. Thus, if your distribution was
    % [1 2 3 1000 1000 1000], the cumulative p values would be the same as if
    % it wasn't sorted, but the plotting wouldn't be right.
    p = cumsum(RT./RT)/length(RT);

    %Why we use norminv:
        %The inverse of any CDF is known as the 'quantile function', and expresses the value a
        %distribution will take at that probability.  Because the CDF is ogival, this will result in a
        %vector that has most of its numbers clustered near the middle, with fewer in the tails; in other
        %words, they will be normally distributed.  For this reason, a straight line will result with the
        %y-axis being a gaussian.

%the time axis is strange, so lets plot it as actual RT

%first set the xlim to range from 150 ms to infinity.
set(gca,'xlim',-1./[150 inf])

%what are the exact RT values you'd like to see on the plot?
xtickvals = [200 300 500 1000 inf]';

%convert the desired x tick values into the reciprocal scale
xtick = sort(-1./xtickvals);

%now set the tick marks to desired locations
set(gca,'xtick',xtick)

%now put the appropriated modified lables
set(gca,'xticklabel',xtickvals)
