The file SimulateModelsPublic.m can be used to run versions of the models 
presented in Purcell, Heitz, Cohen, Logan, Schall, & Palmeri.  Neurally Constrained 
Modeling of Perceptual Decision Making.  Psychological Review.  In Press (April, 2010)

This code will run 1000 simulations using the pooled data set and will plot (1) the observed
and predicted response time distributions and (2) the average model input and the average 
predicted trajectory for 10 simulated trajectories with consective ordered RTs sampled
from the median of the predicted distribution.

Default parameter settings define the Gated Race model (from Table 2).

IMPORTANT: This code cannot operate without the data located in the 'Data' directory
that should have been downloaded with this code.  The 'Data' folder must be located
in the current directory.

In addition, the following files are necssary for this code to run:
GetModelInput.m
mod_spikedensityfunct.m
model.m
PlotModelOutputPublic.m
