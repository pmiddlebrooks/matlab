%Hypergeometric distribution example
% This is related to the Fisher Exact test
% Compares with the binomial distribution that specificies probability of k successes in N draws with
% base rate probability P, WITH REPLACEMENT
%
% Hypergeometric distribution specifies probability of k successes from a finite population of N, which
% is known to contain M successes, WITHOUT REPLACEMENT.

% As an extension, one can use the inverse cumulative hypergeometric distribution to calculate the number
% of successes one would expect by chance alone
