%function err=AcrossSessWInSessCondsTFShuffTest( TestStats,TestStats2,t,f,Nms,ClusShuffOpts,pval )
%
% Like AcrossSessTFShuffTest, but instead of copmaring TestSats in the
% activation period to the baseline period, this compares TestStats1 to
% TestStats2 at every time and frequency location in each. This code enacts
% a between sessions test.
%
%               Note that in terms of the output- TestStats2 is like the
%               "baseline" in other programs in this series. In other
%               words, a significant positive cluster means that TestStats1
%               is significantly higher than TestStats2 at that location,
%               while a significant negative cluster indicates the reverse.
%
% Note that this program does the more common (for monkey neurophysiology)
% within sessions test, used for example if you wanted to compare set size
% 2 and 4 across sessions where data for each set size was gathered. Look
% to AcrossSessWInSessCondsTFShuffTest for the less common between sessions
% test, which compares the values from one group of a type of session to
% the values of a totally different set of a type of session where the
% numbers of sessions in each group don't necessarily have to match up.
% (and as of right now [091111] that code does not work... but I can finish
% it if it is ever needed.)
%
% It is assumed that the values of TestStat correspond to the (possibly
% transformed) values for measures like coherence or power spectra, not
% something like the raw Fourier components from which these values should
% be calculated after shuffling.
%
% This program will simply test the means in TestStats1 vs TestStats2 using
% a signed rank test and shuffling and clustering procedure to determine
% significance
%
% Note- this is a MAGNITUDE based test. Inputs will eb transformed to their
% magnitudes before performing the shuffling and test.
%
% Inputs:
%   TestStats1- a 3D array- [Time x Freq x nSess] of the values for the
%               first condition for each window you would like to test.
%   TestStats2- a 3D array- [Time x Freq x nSess] of the values for the
%               second condition for each window that you would like to
%               test.
%
%               For this code, TestStats1 and Teststas2 MUST BE THE SAME
%               SIZE IN EVERY DIMENSION. This code will take in values for
%               t and f, and ActPer (through ClusShoffOpts) but not
%               BasePer, and it will only test time windows that fall within
%               ActPer (just to maintain consistency with my other code).
%   t-          a 1D vector corresponding to the times of the windows along
%               the first dimeinsion of TestStats
%   f-          a 1D vector corresponding to the frequencies of the windows
%               along the second dimension of TestStats
%   Nms-        The length of the window (in ms) used to calculate
%               TestStats, which is assumed to be either coherence or
%               spectra. This defaults to 200 ms.
%   ClusShuffOpts-  A structure with various options for how to do the
%                   shuffling. See the code below for details.
%   pval-       The pvalue to used to determine which clusters are
%               significant.
%
% Outputs:
%   err-        A structure with the fields Raw, and NormAboveThresh.
%               Raw is a substructure containing the results when
%               NormAboveThresh is set to 0, and NormAboveThresh is a
%               substructure containing results when NormAboveThresh is set
%               to 1. see the help comments in LFP_LFPCoh for more details
%               on what's in those substructures
%
%               Note that in terms of the output- TestStas2 is like the
%               "baseline" in other programs in this series. In other
%               words, a significant positive cluster means that TestStats1
%               is significantly higher than TestStats2 at that location,
%               while a significant negative cluster indicates the reverse.
